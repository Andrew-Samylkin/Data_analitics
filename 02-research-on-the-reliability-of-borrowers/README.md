# Research on the reliability of borrowers


#### Task: 
- Based on statistics on the solvency of clients, investigate whether the marital status and the number of the client's children affect the fact of the loan repayment on time

#### Description:
- We have information about clients of the bank.  Based on this information need make EDA (remove duplicates, change the type of features if necessary, solve problems with anomalies in data). After EDA creates a new feature e.g unique value in education will be an equally unique number.  Based on the income make segmentation of clients of the bank. At the end of the investigation need answer  the following questions:
1.Is there a relationship between the number of children and loan repayment on time?
2.Is there a relationship between marital status and loan repayment on time?
3.Is there a relationship between income and loan repayment on time?
4.How do different purposes of a loan affect its repayment on time?
